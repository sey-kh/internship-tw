|06/28|1. keras normalization experiment||I want to finalize which normalization method I should bring forward then I will apply other techniques to reduce loss. I want to normalize every samples of train_set but I feel a problem e.g two original samples x_1, y_1 = [1,2,3,4], [5] and x_2, y_2 = [2,3,4,5], [6] after transformed -> [0,0.25,0.5,0.75], [1]. To overcome this I have tried `StandardScaler`, `RobustScaler` but they are the same except `MaxAbsScaler` but still `MinMaxScaler` produce better results. For conclusion I prefer MinMaxScaler since I think that sequentially values is very less chance in stock price data or never.
